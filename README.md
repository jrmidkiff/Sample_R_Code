Descriptive Text: 

With this code, I show part of the analysis I did for n = 1,262 responses from a survey asking respondents what it would take 
for them to live in or continue to live in a certain low-income area where they currently work or attend school. 
In addition, the original survey asks for a significant amount of demographic information about the respondents.

This code does not represent the entirety of the analysis that I did on this project. My surpervisor wanted 
me to analyze how respondents varied their answers depending upon seven different 'cross tabs' (household income, presence of children at 
home, location, renter or owner, length of time working, and age group. Of these, I only present one (Age group).

I have modified the survey dataset by removing identifiable information and drastically reducing the number of columns
