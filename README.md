# Sample_R_Code
**Author**:  James Midkiff

**Month and year written**:  September 2017

**Descriptive Text**: 

With this code, I show part of the analysis I did for n = 1,262 responses from a survey asking respondents what it would take for them to live in or continue to live in a certain low-income area where they currently work or attend school. In addition, the original survey asks for a significant amount of demographic information about the respondents.

This code does not represent the entirety of the analysis that I did on this project. My surpervisor wanted to see how respondents varied their answers depending upon seven different 'cross tabs' (household income, presence of children at home, location, renter or owner, length of time working, and age group. **_Of these, I only present one (Age group)_**.

I have modified the survey dataset by removing identifiable information and drastically reducing the number of questions present.

To run the code, you will need to ensure you have all of the packages listed in the 
`library()` command
